# Calvary College Student Mental Health and Coping Mechanism Dashboard

## Overview

This project presents a data-driven dashboard built using Microsoft Excel, analyzing mental health patterns, academic performance, and coping mechanisms among students at **Calvary College**. By integrating behavioral, psychological, and academic variables into a single cohesive visualization, the dashboard offers actionable insights for educational administrators, counselors, and student support services.


##  Project Objectives

- Identify the **optimal study duration** for maximum GPA.
- Evaluate the **impact of stress coping methods** on mental wellness.
- Understand the relationship between **exercise, sleep, social media**, and **stress levels**.
- Examine how **peer pressure** and **family mental health history** correlate with academic and psychological outcomes.
- Offer data-backed **recommendations** for improving student life and academic performance.


## Dashboard Components, Observations & Recommendations

### 1. **Optimal Study Hours for GPA**
- **Observation**: Students studying **30‚Äì39 hours/week** attain the **highest GPA (2.23)**. Studying above 40 hours leads to reduced academic performance.
- **Recommendation**: Encourage students to maintain a **balanced study schedule** in the 30‚Äì39 hour range. Overstudying should be monitored as it may lead to burnout and lower returns.


### 2. **Best Stress Coping Method**
- **Observation**: Among methods like talking to friends, meditation, exercise, and reading, **Yoga** stands out with the **lowest stress level (5.00)**.
- **Recommendation**: Institutions should incorporate **yoga sessions or mindfulness programs** into student wellness initiatives. Provide resources and access to yoga instructors and quiet spaces.


### 3. **Effect of Physical Exercise on Mental Stress**
- **Observation**: Students exercising **8‚Äì10 hours/week** have the **lowest average stress (4.99)**. In contrast, those with 0‚Äì1 hours report the **highest stress (5.80)**.
- **Recommendation**: Promote **structured physical activity programs**. Incentivize participation in group fitness, sports clubs, or wellness challenges.


### 4. **Impact of Social Media Hours on Sleep**
- **Observation**: Students with **0 social media hours** get **8.48 hours of sleep**. Sleep duration declines steadily with increased usage.
- **Recommendation**: Launch **"Digital Detox" campaigns**. Provide workshops on screen hygiene and encourage app-limiting strategies to improve sleep quality.


### 5. **Sleep Hours vs Physical Exercise**
- **Observation**: Students who exercise **5‚Äì9 hours/week** experience **better sleep quality**. However, sleep declines after 10+ hours of weekly exercise.
- **Recommendation**: Promote **moderate exercise regimens** over excessive routines to balance rest and activity.


### 6. **Effect of Study Time on Academic Performance**
- **Observation**: GPAs drop when students study beyond 39 hours, highlighting **diminishing academic returns**.
- **Recommendation**: Counsel students on **efficient study strategies**. Encourage quality over quantity‚Äîactive recall, spaced repetition, and regular breaks.


### 7. **Family Mental Health History vs Stress Levels**
- **Observation**: Students with or without a family mental health history report **equal average stress levels (5.36)**.
- **Recommendation**: Mental health support should be **universal**, not limited to students with known family history. Regular mental wellness screenings are advised.

### 8. ü§ù **Impact of Peer Pressure on GPA**
- **Observation**: Students under **high peer pressure (Level 5)** have the **lowest GPA (1.86)**.
